# etaliSim
A simple probabilistic simulator to test a Magic: The Gathering (MtG) interaction.


Etali, Primal Storm is a card in MtG that removes the top card of each player's deck when you attack with it, then you can play any nonland cards removed by Etali for free.


The Tenth Doctor is another card that, whenever you attack, removes cards from the top of your deck until you find a nonland card, which is then put on a timer to be cast for free 3 turns later.


If you attack with Etali with both of these cards in play, it will trigger both abilities at once. Because of that, MtG's rules let you do these two abilities in any order.


This leads to the question:  
**To maximize Etali's odds of removing a nonland, should I resolve the Tenth Doctor's ability before or after Etali's?**
